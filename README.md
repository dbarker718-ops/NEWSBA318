# Payments app
this is a listing app for my rental properties. 

The data folder has been seperated by 3 files customers,listings, and payments.

a public folder was created with a style css file within it wich has been linked to the index.js folder

next 3 routes were created containing customers, payments, files were made with focus on listings files

within the listings 
routers for get, post, patch, and delete were made.

next a views folder was created with an .ejs file to link the form to the style.css file

within the index file express and ejs are called. also here statuses are defined.
